还是保持相同的人物，以及场景， 延续后面的剧情：

Morning patrol of disaster zones, 35mm film, realistic but oppressive. He's checking the exact locations where disasters began in previous loops. Not paranoia—PTSD.
ELECTRICAL BOX - FIRE ZONE (20-23 sec): 35mm medium shot. Chinese man, 40, wearing white T-shirt and black pants, enters living room, morning grey light through window. Wall visible: typical Chinese apartment aging electrical junction box, white plastic cover slightly yellowed. He walks directly to it, ignoring everything else. Stares at it. 50mm lens close-up: his hand reaches out slowly, trembling, fingers touch the plastic cover—checking temperature. Cool. Safe. For now. But his eyes see something else—MEMORY flash (ultra-brief, 0.5 sec): same box sparking orange, flames licking up. Back to present. He pulls hand back quickly, as if burned. Touches his own palm—faded burn marks there, barely visible. Evidence. Loop 1 left scars. He opens the cover carefully—old circuit breakers inside, some wrapped with tape (Chinese apartment typical aging wiring). Checks each switch. All off. Closes cover. But doesn't look away. Can't. Whispers: "Not this time..."
WINDOW - FLOOD ZONE (23-27 sec): Cuts to living room window/balcony area. 28mm tracking shot follows him. Large window, typical Chinese apartment balcony door. He approaches like approaching edge of cliff. Looks up at sky through window—clear morning, no storm. But his face shows fear. MEMORY flash (0.5 sec): same window, dark storm, rain hammering, water pouring through gaps. Back to present. He crouches, 35mm close-up low angle. Inspects window seal, running fingers along gap where window meets frame. Where water came through. Presses palm against glass, checking—solid, dry. Stands, checks balcony door seal. Touches weather stripping. Everything normal. But he pulls heavy curtain closed anyway, as if blocking out the memory. His wedding ring visible—same ring that was underwater in Loop 2. Turns away, jaw clenched.
DOOR - THEFT ZONE (27-30 sec): Cuts to entrance door. 50mm medium shot. He stands before the door, staring at lock. Door intact now, but his eyes see something else. MEMORY flash (0.5 sec): same door, scratched lock, ajar, violated. Back to present. Extreme close-up 85mm: his hand touches door lock, feeling the metal. Checks deadbolt—locked. Checks again. And again. Three times. Hand moves to door frame edge—touches where lock was pried in Loop 3. No damage now, but his fingers remember. Leans forehead against door, eyes closed. Other hand flat on door surface. Standing there like grieving. Whispering: "Which one? Fire? Water? Theft? Which one today?" Camera holds on his back, vulnerable, waiting.
Camera: Electrical box static then close-up (3 sec). Window tracking then low angle inspection (4 sec). Door slow approach then extreme close-up, holds on his back (3 sec). Progressive claustrophobia.
Color: Entire sequence desaturated, cold. Morning light is grey, not warm. Each disaster zone has subtle color memory: electrical box slight orange tint at edges (fire memory), window slight blue-grey tint (water memory), door slight darkness (theft memory). His skin pale, grey undertones. Heavy film grain.
Sound: Oppressive silence with subtle tension. Electrical box: faint hum when he touches it (60Hz, his imagination?), his fingertip on plastic (soft scrape), breathy whisper "Not this time" barely audible. Window: distant city sounds outside, his palm on glass (dull press), curtain fabric swish (isolating himself from outside threat), breathing controlled tense. Door: lock mechanisms clicking as he checks (metal on metal, sharp), his forehead against door (hollow wood thud), whisper "Which one?" voice cracked, defeated. Building ambience underneath (50Hz hum) becomes oppressive. His heartbeat 100bpm present throughout.
Emotional core: He's not preparing for potential disasters. He's REVISITING crime scenes from loops he's already lived. Each location triggers traumatic memory. He has physical scars (burns on hand) and psychological scars (PTSD). He's trying to prevent what he knows will happen, but doesn't know WHICH disaster comes next. The uncertainty is torture.
